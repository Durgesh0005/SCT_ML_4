# ✋ Hand Gesture Classification – ML Task 04

## 🧠 Machine Learning Task 04 – SkillCraft Technology

This project focuses on classifying **hand gestures** using traditional machine learning. The goal was to recognize different gesture labels based on image features extracted from a labeled dataset.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Classify hand gestures (e.g., Palm, Fist, Thumbs Up, etc.)
- Apply machine learning algorithms to image-based gesture recognition
- Evaluate model accuracy and performance

---

## 🗂️ Dataset

- **Dataset**: Pre-labeled hand gesture images
- **Classes**: Multiple static gestures
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Resized to fixed shape (e.g., 64x64 pixels)
  - Grayscale conversion
  - Flattened into vectors

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **OpenCV** – Image preprocessing
- **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn** – ML models (SVM, KNN, Decision Tree)
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – Visualization
